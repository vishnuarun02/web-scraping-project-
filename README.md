# web-scraping-project
### Project Outline:

- `Quotes To Scrape` is a website that hosts hundreds of intriguing quotes. It is complied by  ['Scraping Hub'](https://www.zyte.com/)  from the website ['Good Reads'](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes?page=1).
- In this Web Scraping Project we will scrape the website, extract details like `Quote` `Author` `Genre Related Topic Tags` `About Author` and store it in a dataframe of `CSV FORMAT`. 
- We will first use the requests library and download the web pages into a file.
- We will then use Beautiful Soup library to parse and extract information from the downloaded or locally saved webpage data.
- We will then define function for accessing various parts of the data and save it into python lists.
- We then define another function that combines the utility of all the previously defined functions into one. 
- Using this function we get all the required data and save it into a CSV file.
